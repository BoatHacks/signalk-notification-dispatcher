# Vendored webapp dependencies

`htm-preact-standalone.module.js` is htm's `preact/standalone` build
(from the `htm` npm package, version 3.1.1), vendored here as a static
file rather than loaded from a CDN at runtime.

## Why vendored instead of loaded from a CDN

The original version of this webapp imported Preact and htm directly
from `unpkg.com` inside a `<script type="module">` tag. On a boat, the
browser rendering this webapp is very often talking only to the local
SignalK server with no wider internet access. Since ES module `import`
statements are all resolved *before* any code in the module runs, a
single failed CDN import silently aborts the entire script - the page
just renders its background color forever, with no visible error
unless the browser's dev tools happen to be open. Vendoring removes
that failure mode entirely: everything the webapp needs ships with the
plugin.

## Why this one file specifically

`htm`'s `preact/standalone` build is fully self-contained - it bundles
Preact core, `preact/hooks`, and htm's tagged-template compiler into a
single file with zero external imports (unlike importing `preact`,
`preact/hooks`, and `htm` separately, which pulls in a bare `"preact"`
specifier inside the hooks build that browsers can't resolve without
either an import map or vendoring Preact separately too). It exports
`h`, `html` (already bound), `render`, `Component`, and the hooks used
by this webapp (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, etc.) - see the
`export { ... }` statement at the end of the file for the full list.

## Updating

To refresh to a newer `htm`/Preact release:

```
npm install htm@<version> --no-save
cp node_modules/htm/preact/standalone.module.js public/vendor/htm-preact-standalone.module.js
```

Then update the version note below and re-run the plugin's test suite.

Currently vendored: `htm` 3.1.1 (which bundles Preact 10.19.3).
